Path to Independence chronicles pivotal moments in African liberation movements, from early organizing to national
independence. The exhibition highlights leadership councils, student mobilizations, and cross-border solidarity that
shaped the continent's future.

Visitors will encounter archival photographs, campaign materials, and personal testimonies that connect local
communities to a shared continental story.
