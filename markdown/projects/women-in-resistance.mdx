Women in Resistance centers the organizing, intelligence work, and public education led by women across the
continent. The exhibition includes letters, textiles, and photographs that show the depth of their leadership and
the networks they built to sustain liberation efforts.

Interactive listening stations share oral histories from educators, couriers, and organizers whose work changed the
course of history.
