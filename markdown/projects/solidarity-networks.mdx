Solidarity Networks examines the alliances between liberation movements, diaspora communities, and international
partners. Through letters, travel documents, and photographs, the exhibition shows how coordination and mutual aid
strengthened the struggle for freedom.

Interactive maps highlight routes of support, training centers, and cross-border cooperation that shaped history.
