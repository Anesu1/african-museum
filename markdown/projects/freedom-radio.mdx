Freedom Radio explores the role of underground broadcasting in liberation struggles. The gallery features restored
audio reels, signal equipment, and first-hand accounts from broadcasters who kept communities informed and connected.

Visitors can listen to historic clips, explore broadcast maps, and learn how messages crossed borders during
critical moments of resistance.
