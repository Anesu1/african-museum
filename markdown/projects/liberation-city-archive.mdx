The Liberation City Archive is the research heart of the museum. It preserves primary sources from liberation-era
movements, including personal letters, photographs, meeting notes, and recorded interviews.

Researchers and community members may request access to materials by appointment. Digitization efforts continue to
expand public access to these important records.
