The Museum of African Liberation has opened a new oral history collection that brings together testimonies from
activists, educators, and community organizers across the continent. This archive emphasizes regional leadership,
cross-border solidarity, and the everyday work of building liberation movements.

Researchers can access digitized transcripts and audio in the reading room by appointment. Community members are
also invited to submit materials or schedule interviews to preserve family stories for future generations.

This collection will continue to grow as we partner with universities, cultural institutions, and local councils.
