The Museum of African Liberation invites the public to Community Day at Liberation City, a free program dedicated
to intergenerational learning and shared remembrance. Throughout the day, museum guides will lead short tours
highlighting regional liberation movements, from early organizing to independence milestones.

Visitors can join storytelling circles featuring oral history excerpts from activists, educators, and families who
contributed to liberation efforts. Youth workshops will focus on archival preservation, interview skills, and the
role of music and poetry in resistance.

Community Day is also a chance to connect with our research team about contributing photographs, letters, and
personal collections to the museum archive. We look forward to welcoming families, students, and partners for a day
of learning, reflection, and celebration.
