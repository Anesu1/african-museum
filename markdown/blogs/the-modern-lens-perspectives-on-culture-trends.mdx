Inside the museum restoration lab, conservators are stabilizing textiles, banners, and photographs that reflect the
visual language of liberation movements. Each item is carefully cleaned, documented, and rehoused in archival
materials to ensure long-term preservation.

Recent efforts include repairing a series of liberation-era posters and digitizing photographs for public access.
These resources will be featured in upcoming exhibitions and research sessions.

The restoration lab welcomes partnerships with conservation students and heritage organizations. If you are
interested in supporting preservation work, contact the museum for volunteer and training opportunities.
